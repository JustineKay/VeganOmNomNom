### Unit-2-hw-1 Objective
Using either the **[Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com)** or the **[Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview)**, fetch a list of places near a specific location. 

Your application should also provide the ability to view additional data (category, address, avatar, etc)

**The interesting part**  
On the detail page, your application must provide one additional piece of information provided by another api. For example, fetch the number of Twitter followers based on their twitter handle. Or pull instagram pictures based on the category of the venue.
